It's just a sample app to demonstrate usage of MVVM pattern on Android platform using Kotlin language.

Additionally following libraries were used:

- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- [Mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin)
